## Background

This project is an implementation of the calculation of the Maximum Likelihood Threshold for samples from a multinormal distribution, and numerical modeling for when the sample size is less than the number of dimensions of the distribution for distributions less than nine dimensions.

This project is from the Tulane University Department of Mathematics.

## Code

To install the required packages and dependencies, create a conda environment from `environment.yml`. Source code is available under `/code` - the implementation of the MLT modeling functions are under `MLTCalculator.ipynb`, and the generation of the figures is available under `generate_plots.ipynb`.

## Poster

This project was presented at the [SIAM AG23 Conference in Eindhoven](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/ag23), Netherlands in July 2023. The poster is available under `materials/ag23poster` in its most recent form, as well as the source LaTeX code and assets. The theme is built on the [tulane-gemini](https://github.com/outlawhayden/tulane-gemini) theme, which is a fork of the Gemini beamer theme for use at Tulane University.
