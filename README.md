## Background

## Code

To install the required packages and dependencies, create a conda environment from `environment.yml`. Source code is available under `/code` - the implementation of the MLT modeling functions are under `MLTCalculator.ipynb`, and the generation of the figures is available under `generate_plots.ipynb`.

## Poster

This project was presented at the [SIAM AG23 Conference in Eindhoven](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/ag23), Netherlands in July 2023. The poster is available under `materials/ag23poster` in its most recent form, as well as the source LaTeX code and assets. The theme is built on the [tulane-gemini](https://github.com/outlawhayden/tulane-gemini) theme, which is a fork of the Gemini beamer theme for use at Tulane University.
